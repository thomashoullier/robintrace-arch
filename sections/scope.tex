\section{Scope}
Poaky deals with tracing rays of light through optical systems,
under the laws of geometrical optics. It allows defining an optical system
with surfaces which propagate rays through the system. Poaky reports the
state of rays at given optical surfaces.

The following optical design related items are left out:
\begin{itemize}
\item Phase computation: The rays are purely described by their trajectory.
\item Building objective functions and constraints: This belongs in a higher
layer which uses the states of rays to build performance criteria.
\item Optimization: This is an even higher layer than objective functions.
\item Ray-aiming: We can implement this on top of the current program.
\item User-level optical system definition: The optical system defined
      by the user does not use the same formalism as that of the current
      program.
\end{itemize}

Many concepts about raytracing have been explored in depth in a previous
work \cite{Houllier-thesis}.

\textcolor{red}{Whether ray-aiming and higher functions will be included
in the current repository or another is not yet decided.}
