\section{Freeform surfaces}
The addition of freeform surfaces is planned at some point.
We have the following ideas.

\begin{itemize}
\item In the case of an iterative intersection algorithm. The intersections can
      be managed at the lpart level by feeding rays to the intersection search
      with a value already initialized by a nearby, previously computed ray.
      The gain is debatable when the freeform is of low departure.
\item Consider the tradeoff between bounding box technique, or just ray-walking
forward and/or backward.
\end{itemize}
