\section{API layers}
RobinTrace is constituted by a several API layers. We list them, along with a
succinct description, in order of increasing abstraction.

\subsection{Poaky}
Poaky is the lowest layer. It defines individual rays and the operations which
can be applied on these rays. It contains many mathematical definitions
such as algorithms for ray operations and shapes used in raytracing. As such,
it comes with a heavy paper documentation.

\subsection{Pinyo}
Pinyo is the layer of abstraction on top of Poaky. It defines ray bundles and
low-level optical parts (\textit{eg} a refractive shape, a transfer part) which
operate on ray bundles. The operations of parts on bundles of rays are an
opportunity to define fine-grained ray error cases management.
