\section{Ideas}
We list development ideas.

\begin{itemize}
\item Differential raytracing: There are several applications of it.
      \textcolor{red}{TODO: List Volatier papers}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Differentiable MF by backpropagation to the design variables. This
        forces the MF to be defined in terms of differentiable operations on
        rays, which is mostly the case typically. The optimization can be
        carried out using gradient-aware search algorithms. We can extend this
        to the Hessian matrix. The gradients and more importantly Hessian matrix
        could be established automatically by a math library at compile time.
  \item Provide gradients to get out of error raytracing cases, either in
        ray-aiming or in optimization.
\end{itemize}
\item Vulkan/Qt 3D real-time display of optical systems. We could plot in
      real-time the current best system in optimization, or the last evaluated
      by the search.
\item Real-time plot of design space exploration. We could use a n-dimensional
      to 3D/2D library to represent the exploration of the design space by the
      search algorithms. 
\item Paraxial approximation of raytracing. This can be useful as a surrogate
      to the search problem, and for ray-aiming initialization.
      \textcolor{red}{TODO: Find Gross work on raytracing matrices.}
\end{itemize}
